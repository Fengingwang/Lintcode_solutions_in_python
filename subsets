there is one point what we need to point out:
if nums is None: return []
if len(nums) == 0: return [[]]
this is right
or only the below one is also right 
if nums is None: return []
but teh below one is not right 
if len(nums) == 0: return []
so we need to know the difference of 
None and len(nums) == 0
The first one is blank input, no input
The second one is like []
